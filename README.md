# Applications-oGV-GraphQL
The function `getOpportunityApplications_oGV` retrieves data from a GraphQL endpoint using a defined query to fetch all opportunity applications within a specified timeframe and for a specific program type (programme ID 7). It then processes the retrieved data to extract relevant details such as application ID, applicant's full name, ID, phone number, educational backgrounds, creation date, host LC name, home MC name, current status, opportunity title and ID, duration type, and program short name display. This data is formatted into rows and written into a Google Sheets spreadsheet named 'ðŸŒŽ applications | oGV' for further analysis and management of opportunities related to Global Volunteer programs. The function ensures to handle null values gracefully where certain fields may not be populated in the retrieved data.
